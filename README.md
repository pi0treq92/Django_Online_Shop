How to install rosetta and gettext-tools for translation on Windows?
<br>
<br>
In windows you just need to download :
<br>
&emsp;gettext-tools-xx.zip
<br>
&emsp;gettext-runtime-xx.zip

from here:<a href="http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/dependencies/"> enter link description here</a>

Then you need to unzip them and copy all in bin folder of both files into:
<br>C:\Program Files\gettext-utils\bin 
<br>then you need to go to control panel-> system -> advanced -> environment variables and add this path:<br>C:\Program Files\gettext-utils\bin to path variables. 
<br>
<br>
Note: xx is the version you want to download if you download version 18 you will get an error that some dll file is missing, I suggest to download version 17
    this folder :gettext-utils\bin does not exist and you need to create it
    restart your pc before you use gettext
<br>
<br>
After settings Languages in settings.py in the shell type:<br>
&emsp;django-admin makemessages --all <br>
You should get the following output:<br>
&emsp;processing locale en<br>
&emsp;processing locale pl<br>
<br>
If you get something like that:<br>
&emsp;CommandError: Can't find msguniq. Make sure you have GNU gettext tools 0.15 or newer installed.
<br>
Check once more if you correctly did steps above.<br>
<br>
To complie your translation in .po files type in the shell:<br>
&emsp;django-admin compilemessages
